# Continuous Glider Simulation  
**Name:** Kellen Knop 
**Date:** April 16, 2025

This project simulates a **continuous glider** using color animation in C++.  
The main file is: `CAAnimate.cpp`.

The program displays a representation of glider movement in a cellular automaton-like environment, enhanced with color for visual clarity.
