# Glider Simulation Project  
**Name:** Kellen Knop  
**Date:** April 16, 2025

This project simulates two types of gliders using C++:

- **Discrete Glider (Black & White):** Implemented in `CAAnimate.cpp`. This simulates a glider using a cellular automaton and Conway's Game of Life.
- **Continuous Glider (Color):** Implemented in `continuousglider.cpp`. This version also uses a cellular automaton, except it implements "fuzzy" (continuous) logic from Game of Life. It simulates a glider with smooth, continuous motion and visual output in color.

## Tools & Assistance

I used **GitHub Copilot** and **Google Gemini** to assist with coding and debugging during development.
